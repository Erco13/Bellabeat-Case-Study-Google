# Bellabeat Case Study — Google Data Analytics Capstone ( Samedin Ercan Onur )

## Business question
Analyze smart-device usage to: find key trends, map them to Bellabeat customers, and recommend marketing strategies to drive acquisition, engagement, and retention.
## Data & method (short)
- Cleaned Fitbit-style device logs in **Excel** (list files you used)  
- Cross‑checked totals, removed duplicates, parsed dates  
- Built initial visuals in Excel (list your charts)  

## Key findings (replace with your numbers and chart references)
1. **Average Dailiy Activity** — ~6,547 (median ~5,986); 27.8% of days hit 10k+ steps ( see `reports/figures/average_dailiy_activity.png`)
2. **Average Dashboard** — Calories , Distance , Steps see `reports/figures/average_dashboard.png`.
3. **Correlation on Activity and Calories** — Steps vs calories r ≈ 0.58 (moderate) (see `reports/figures/correlation_activity_vs_calories.png`)
4. **Sedentary vs Active per minutes** — see `reports/figures/minutes_sedentary_vs_active.png`.
5. **Sedentary vs Active per distance** — see `reports/figures/distance_sedentary_vs_active.png`.
6. **Average Sleep Hours** - Avg sleep: 6.56 h; 53.3% of logged days have <7 h sleep (see ` reports/figures/average_sleep_hours.png`)

## Recommendations
- Daily streaks + smart alerts to 7.5k–10k steps ( “finish your 10k” prompts).
- Sleep coaching when weekly average <7 h .
- Calorie-aware activity goals (set targets to achive a calorie burn goal).
- 14-day onboarding free-journey for new users to build a habit .
