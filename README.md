## Business Task (Ask)
Identify simple, actionable usage patterns that Bellabeat could use to encourage healthier activity and app engagement.

## Data Source (Prepare)
- Public Fitbit fitness tracker data (sample).  
- Time period & granularity: daily activity, sleep, heart rate (where available).  
- Data quality notes: small sample size, possible self-reporting bias, limited demographics.

## Tools
- **Excel / Google Sheets** (quick checks, pivots, charts)  
- **SQL** (explore & aggregate)  
- **R (tidyverse)** (cleaning + simple plots)

## Process
1. Import files; verify columns and types.
2. Remove duplicates, handle missing values.
3. Join daily activity with sleep where possible.
4. Create simple metrics: steps/day, active minutes/day, calories/day.
5. Visualize trends by weekday and activity level.

## Analysis (Key Findings â€” draft)
- Users are most active on **[weekday here]**; steps drop on **[weekday here]**.
- Higher **active minutes** are associated with higher **calories burned**.
- Users with **consistent sleep** tend to show **more stable activity**.

## Share
- Simple charts in `reports/figures/`  
- Summary in `reports/summary/EXEC_SUMMARY.md`

## Act (Recommendations)
- In-app nudges for low-activity weekdays.
- Weekly step goal reminders + streak badges.
- Bedtime reminders for consistency.
