# Bellabeat Usage Insights — Capstone (by **YOUR NAME**, aspiring junior data analyst)

Hi! I'm **YOUR NAME**, an aspiring junior data analyst. This repo contains **my** version of the Bellabeat case study. I cleaned Fitbit-style activity data in Excel and built first visuals there; then I organized everything in a reproducible structure so it’s easy to review.

> Replace this paragraph with **your own 3–4 sentences**: what you looked at, what tools you used (Excel + optional Python/R/SQL), and the outcome in plain language.
